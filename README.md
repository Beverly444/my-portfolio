# my-portfolio :3 

# Hello, I'm Beverly Rivas, a full-time professional working in the mortgage industry as a Document Request and Loan Officer Assistant. I specialize in staying organized, managing details under pressure, and helping streamline the homebuying process—skills I’ve built through hard work, long commutes, and real-world hustle.

# Outside of work, I’m teaching myself how to code—focusing on Python—and building the discipline to break into tech, one line at a time. I don’t have a formal degree, but I do have determination, curiosity, and a sharp eye for solving problems. Whether it’s cleaning up data or troubleshooting code, I’m always eager to learn something new.

# In my downtime, you can catch me at the gym lifting weights, staying focused, and pushing my limits both mentally and physically. I believe growth happens when you show up for yourself—day after day—even when no one’s watching.

# I’m open to connecting with others who are chasing goals, changing lanes, or just figuring it out like I am. Let’s learn, build, and level up together.
